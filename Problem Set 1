# Problem set 1 (A) - Is the Word Guessed
We will start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the Hangman problem.
First, implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two parameters -a string, secretWord, 
and a list of letters, letterGuessed. The function returns a boolean -True if secretWord has been 
guessed (ie, all the letters of secretWord are in letterGuessed) and False otherwise.


def isWordGuessed(secretWord, letterGuessed):
    '''
    secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing 
    lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
        False otherwise
    '''
    print(letterGuessed)
    for letter in letterGuessed:     # Pick out guessed letter one at a time
        if letter not in secretWord: # Check if guessed letter in secretWord
            return False             # False returned as soon as letter does not match
    return True                      # if everything matches, exits loop and True returned
